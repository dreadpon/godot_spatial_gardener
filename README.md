# What is it for?

It's meant to simplify foliage placement in a natural-feeling way without having to use heightmap terrain or writing procedural placement algorithms.

It can also handle thousands of foliage instances without completely tanking the FPS (with an reasonable setup).

This is a single player plugin and works best with finite medium-sized scenes. Think platformers, shooters, adventure games, anything with a hand-made level.

# Stability

This plugin was developed and tested using Godot v3.4.2, but should work fine on most 3.x versions.

Its relatively stable on Windows, but not tested on other platforms.

Want a test-drive? Go to [Releases](https://github.com/dreadpon/godot_spatial_gardener/releases) and get the most recent windows build: `godot_spatial_gardener_showcase_windows_x64.zip`.

# Tutorial

For a detailed guide you can refer to my tutorial.

It comes in two formats, depending on your preference:

- **[<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/1Xd30ySv/yt-icon-rgb.png" width="16" style="margin-right:4px"/> Video (recommended)](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtsfK5HW0bX-TKR8eO_uKEguii8w9dGIh)**
- **[<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/KzF6WwQx/text-icon.png" width="16" style="margin-right:4px"/> Text](reference/TUTORIAL_ROOT.md)**

Their contents are the same, but video better illustrates each step due to being a video, duh.
