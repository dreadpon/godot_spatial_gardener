# A helper class that creates a placement area (grid)
# And makes sure all instances of a given plant are evenly spaced
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# It uses a 2D grid-based algorithm to maintain both:
	# close-to-desired instance density
	# an even instance distribution
# This article was used as a main reference (grid uses a simple logic and gives good-enough results)
	# https://www.gamedeveloper.com/disciplines/random-scattering-creating-realistic-landscapes
# However, I was not able to derive a solution that creates a grid that evenly projects on a surface of any angle
	# When you approach 45 degrees you start seeing bigger spacing, which becomes unusable by 90 degrees
	# So I thought of trying to project a 3D grid, but that raised a lot of questions on it's own
	# This is still an open question really
# So I dug through some code online and decided on a system I discuss in BrushPlacementArea section

# Algorithm:
	# Use the brush radius, position and the surface normal under it's center to describe a flat circle in 3D space
	# This circle provides a plane and bounds for us to generate the transforms. Most other operations operate in 2D space aligned to said plane
	# Generate a virtual 2D grid with distance between points representing the plant density (less density == bigger distance)
	# Find all "overlapping" plants of the same type in the sphere's radius
		# We only check if the placements (origin positions) of plants are within the sphere. No actual boundary tests
	# Add a max instance check (how many instances total can fit in a circle) and pad the max distance from center slightly OUTSIDE the circle
		# Last one is needed to prevent spawning at half-distance near the circle's edge
	# Project the overlaps to our plane and snap them to the closest point on the grid
		# These grid points become occupied and cannot spawn a new instance
	# All the points that remain will spawn an instance
	# Add a random jitter to each placement (it should be smaller than 0.5 to prevent occasional overlap)
	# Get the raycast start and end positions
		# They are aligned to the plane's normal and clamped at the sphere's bounds
			# Last one prevents out raycast from going outside the sphere
	# Back in the StrokeHandler, use these positions to raycast to surface and determine actual placement positions

# The problem with this method is that the grid CAN and WILL be generated at uneven intervals as the brush moves
# An example, where "( )" - last grid, "[ ]" - current grid, "P" - point
	# (P)(P)
	# (P)(P)    <- align
	#   [P][P]  <- align
	#   [P][P]
	#    /\
	#    do not align
# That leads to some points spawning closer than they should
# While not ideal, this is somewhat mitigated with max instances check
# And snapping brush to the virtual grid
# Ideally I would like the grid to be independent from the brush position
	# But I don't know how to accurately project 3D grid points on an angled surface while keeping them EVENLY SPACED no matter the angle
	# 2D grids give me a close enough result

# TODO Write an article discussing this method that is actually readable by a normal human being
