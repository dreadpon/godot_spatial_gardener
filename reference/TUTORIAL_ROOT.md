# Spatial Gardener Tutorial
Welcome to the Spatial Gardener tutorial for Godot, a plugin for painting plants and props in your levels.

I will teach you how to add a Gardener to your scene; how to setup up a plant mesh and configure its placement settings; how to paint, erase and update your plants; and what kind of optimization this plugin uses.

You'll be using this playground scene as a testing ground:

By the end of this tutorial you’ll be able to create a diverse environment like this one.

But first, about this plugin. It’s used for painting any kind of props or foliage with even distribution on arbitrary surfaces. This is a single player plugin and works best with finite medium-sized levels. Its relatively stable on Windows, but needs additional testing on other platforms. I encourage you to share your own experience in `Issues` or on my [Discord](https://discord.gg/CzRSk8E).

They's two parts to this:

**Note:** some images might be taken from different versions of this plugin, but information itself is relevant to the most recent stable one.
